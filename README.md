# Introduction

[An analysis by Natanson in 2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/virginia-school-exams-sol-scores-covid/2021/09/01/781483a2-0b4f-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html) showed that Virginia SOL test scores dropped disproportionately from 2019 to 2021 across all subjects for Black and Hispanic students. Using datasets from the Virginia Department of Education, and statistical techniques such as simple and multiple linear regression, our analysis examines the extent to which disparities in mode of instruction (i.e. remote vs in-person) influenced the pandemic's disproportionate impact on the test scores of minority students.
